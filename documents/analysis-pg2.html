<div style="position: absolute; width: 846px; height: 452px; z-index: 3; left: 11px; top: 87px" id="layer3">
	<span style="font-weight: 700; text-decoration: underline"><font size="5">
	Step 2 - find </font></span><span style="text-decoration: underline">
	<font size="5"><span style="font-weight: 700">a first time-hypothesis</span></font></span><p>
	<span style="font-size: 13pt">a dcf message can be divided into different 
	bands: general info, minute, hour, day, weekday, month and year band. There 
	are actually 60 different values/constellations for the minute band, 24 for 
	the hour band, 31 for the day band and 12 for the month band. It seems most 
	practicable to search each band as a whole, for all of&nbsp; its possible 
	values. While each minute band will be forwarded one step per minute to give 
	a single one matching&nbsp; band, the hours, day, month will be left without 
	any forwarding as long as the time hypothesis is not yet clearly found. The 
	user shall be given the advise better not to start the application at the 
	end of an hour, since otherwise, the detection of a hypothesis might take 
	some longer because the hour band will be set&nbsp; forward undetected after 
	minute 59.. </span></p>
	<p><span style="font-size: 13pt">Once the minute is found clearly, the hours 
	can be forwarded one position as well after the 59th minute, as well as in 
	the same manner&nbsp; the days, months and years. Probable it will be best 
	to use some kind of weighted average over several minutes to define the 
	correlations <font face="Times New Roman">&#961;</font>, so that any wrong value 
	will fall out soon. Since the years can have rather a lot of values but very 
	seldom a change during application run, their value shall be found on a one 
	bit per correlation base and not as a band.</span></p>
	<p><span style="font-size: 13pt">It has to be verified with PTB that they 
	always use the same constellation of bits for any single value since there 
	are more than one possibility for many values.</span></p>
	<p><span style="font-size: 13pt">During a time hypothesis is searched, the 
	application will also verify the 0-second position and </span>
	<font face="Times New Roman" style="font-size: 13pt">&#948;T. Therefor second 
	58,59, 0 and 1 will be recorded on a sec100 granularity with the 0-1 mask, 
	the 0-second position will be tested within second 59 and 0. Any &#948;T will be 
	updated discretely and in case of a 0-second position error, step 0 and 1 
	will be repeated completely.</font></div>

<div style="position: absolute; width: 845px; height: 304px; z-index: 4; left: 11px; top: 609px" id="layer4">
	<span style="font-weight: 700; text-decoration: underline"><font size="5">
	Step 3 - verify</font></span><span style="text-decoration: underline"><font size="5"><span style="font-weight: 700"> 
	time-hypothesis</span></font></span><p><span style="font-size: 13pt">As soon 
	as all the time bands are found clearly, statistics will be reset, and the 
	hypothesis checked over a few minutes. Now all the timebands will be 
	forwarded as needed. It is not yet clear, if the bands shall be checked for 
	correlation to all its possible value or just towards the expected value. It 
	is foreseen, to calculate the normal average values instead of the weighted 
	values, with regualr statistics update, respectively setting average over 
	n-values as average over much less values (eg. 1, 3 or 5) to give the 
	current values more weight..... yet to be defined...</span></p>
	<p><span style="font-size: 13pt">Again, the 0-second position and</span><font face="Times New Roman" style="font-size: 13pt"> 
	&#948;T </font><span style="font-size: 13pt">&nbsp;will be checked/updated in the 
	same way as in step 2.</span></p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p><span style="font-weight: 700; text-decoration: underline">
	<font size="5">Step 4 - time forwarding in real-time</font></span></p>
	<p><span style="font-size: 13pt">After a short time of time-hypothesis 
	verification, the time shall be forwarded in realtime to the user. This will 
	be done in dcf coding at the same time, the code comes in since the 
	application knows it in forward, but also it shall be transmitted as time 
	string over RS232, USB. </span></p>
