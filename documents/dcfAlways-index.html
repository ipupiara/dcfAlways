	<span style="font-size: 13pt">&quot;DCF77 is a longwave time 
	signal and standard-frequency radio station. Its primary and backup 
	transmitter are located in Mainflingen, about 25&nbsp;km south-east of Frankfurt 
	am Main, Germany. It is operated by Media Broadcast GmbH (previously a 
	subsidiary of Deutsche Telekom AG), on behalf of the Physikalisch-Technische 
	Bundesanstalt, Germany's national physics laboratory. DCF77 has been in 
	service as a standard-frequency station since 1959; date and time 
	information was added in 1973. The timestamp sent is either in UTC+1 or 
	UTC+2 depending on daylight saving time.&quot;&nbsp; </span> </p>

	<p><span style="font-size: 13pt">There are a lot of cheap dcf receivers available on the market as well as 
	much expensive ones. I tested some of the cheap ones and found so far no one 
	that was able to receive a useful time signal during day time. With good 
	luck receiption is possible during night time, maybe best at 2 o'clock in the 
	morning when there is not so much radio wave traffic around in the air. 
	But many times we did not even receive satisfactory time signals during the night in 
	location Schwyz above the city. This brought me to the idea to construct a 
	message signal receiver that can handle these errors by receiving multiple 
	messages, which each one takes 1 minute, and calculate the true message out 
	of several weak or defective messages. Because I did not find anything 
	similar already on the market, it might be a possiblity to sell some kind of 
	construction kit to the public out of the</span> result of this project.</p>
